# well, its the end.
discontinuing because of dicords redesign breakng the css while also still working or something idk how to explain it and i have too many things to do that i can't take care of the theme well, so goodbye cutthetheme, you were a good one.


# CutTheTheme
Simple Powercord theme which tries to replicate the default CutTheCord theme. Please excuse this page looking bad, it's my first time using GitHub.


Note that user statuses look strange and can't find a way to fix it, (because small brain) but I just installed RadialStatus then changed the css to 5% to achieve square heaven.
