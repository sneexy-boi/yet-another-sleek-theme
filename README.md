# CutTheTheme
Simple Powercord theme which tries to replicate the default CutTheCord theme. Please excuse this page looking bad, it's my first time using GitHub.


Note that user statuses look strange and can't find a way to fix it, (because small brain) but I just installed RadialStatus then changed the css to 5% to achieve square heaven.
